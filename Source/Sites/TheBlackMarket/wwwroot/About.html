	<p>This site was the result of 2 weeks of pain staking work to obtain the data, funnel it into a database, extract every permutation that could be had and then to create this front-end you see before you.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Honestly I'm glad the contest is over so I can actually play League of Legends again, but making all of this was fun, and using Riot's assets to provide hopefully some interesting insights into various statistics across regions and teams can be discovered by others. I'm still digging through the data myself, and data is beautiful.</p>
	<br />
	<p>The source for all of this work can be found over <a href="https://github.com/rpowers3/TheBlackMarket" target="_blank">here</a>.	</p>
	<br />
	<p>Many thanks to the various 3rd party APIs that facilitated making this: Aforge, Angular, D3, DNVM, NVD3, FFMpeg, Howler, MongoDB, SASS, Videogular, Visual Studio.</p>
